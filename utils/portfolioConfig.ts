And to top it all off, they were stored as .TIF images, which is an encoded format, and therefore useless for any real-time mathematical operations."

Based on these values, I then calculated which sections of the matrices I needed to just cover Morocco, cut them out, and stored all this information as metadata to be used in the SQL queries. Then I inserted the data into an SQL database, with one table for each row. Then it was just a matter of wiring it all together within a Node server, and creating a basic front-end for accepting parameters and displaying results."

But in this case, they needed to change content very frequently. Whether it be a manual, some car specs, a legislation change, an FAQ, or an entirely new page, these were to be done by people who make cars all day, not websites. So, having something that mimicked Word and Excel while being able to edit and publish changes immediately was a big draw for them.",
            "However I still developed everything that required back-end architecture outside of Wordpress to avoid deprecation, which was mainly the car configurator and a contact form. To achieve this hybrid model, I stored the car models, parts, engine options, and color options in a separate database. Due to how customizable these cars are, the configuration options were very interrelated and had complex conditionals, so they wouldn't have been achievable inside Wordpress's framework. I then created basic CRUD operations and used these inside the Wordpress portal for data entry. Using Wordpress's \"Shortcode\", I was able to inject my own PHP into the block editor to render the configuration UI, such that other users can still edit the page's content."
