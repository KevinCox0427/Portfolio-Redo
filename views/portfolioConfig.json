        "problem": [
            "Much of the environmental signage in the zoo did not assist in navigation, but was purely informational. Since the campus was very hilly, the owners felt it was important to lay out the navigation upfront, so that those with accessiblity issues could be more comfortable navigating the zoo. They also felt that the map pamphlets looked outdated, and wanted something more stylized."
        ],
        "solution": [
            "To ease the costs of this project, I used the dimensions of the previous signs so that they could simply swap the printed sheets incase in the glass. These would then point to the direction of the next exhibit, to clearly instruct the user where to go without having to reference the map.",
            "I also made sure to make the campus maps as large as possible with topographic features, as the previous map was quite small. I went with a retro style heavily influence by the famous national park branding and typography from the 1980's. The front was decorated like of these posters to further strengthen the brand and act as a keep-sake."
